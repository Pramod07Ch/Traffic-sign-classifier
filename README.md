# Traffic-sign-classifier

## Project outline

With motto to learn working on CNN, i have applied a basic approach to genelaize the current project dataset.
In this project, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to classify traffic signs based on German Traffic Sign Dataset. With Tensorflow framewrok, I have trained and validated a model that generalizes the various traffic signs in dataset.

The model has a validation accuracy of 95.2% and test accuracy of 94.4%. The model is also tested on random images from internet.

For more details on working, please refer to the .ipynb notebook.
